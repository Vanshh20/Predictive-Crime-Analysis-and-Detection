# Predictive Crime Detection System (In Development)

## Overview

This project is focused on developing a predictive crime detection system that uses machine learning and data analysis to identify potential crime hotspots and detect suspicious activity. The goal is to help law enforcement and communities prevent crime by analyzing patterns and providing actionable insights.

## Features (In Development)

- **Crime Hotspot Detection**: Uses Random Forest to identify geographic areas with a higher likelihood of criminal activity based on historical data.
- **Repeat Offender Prediction**: Employs LSTM models to predict the probability of repeat offenses based on past crime data.
- **Real-time Crime Alerts**: Detects potential criminal activity in real-time and sends notifications to users and authorities.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualizes crime data on a map for easier identification of high-risk areas.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Live Data Feeds**: Incorporating real-time data from surveillance systems and public sources.
- **Mobile App for Citizens**: Alerts users when entering or residing in high-risk areas.

## Technologies

- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, LSTM
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Folium, GeoPandas

## Status

This project is currently under active development.
